# Executive Summary

Team Watts has a viable business model in which a trained image
classification model becomes the principal component of a grab-and-go
cafeteria automation system. There are over 3000 malls in Canada that
would be targeted as potential customers in Canada alone, to say nothing
of hospitals, sports facilities, and schools. The project is financially
sustainable and highly profitable, returning 75 share percent of revenue
in its first year. The ensemble model method is performing at 70%
accuracy on a single target, and 100% on a double target. The model is
still under active development to deal with overfitting. The data used
in the demonstration described herein was of mixed quality and will be
replaced by bespoke data collected from customer sites.

# Business Case

## Problem Definition

Time has become a significant factor for many individuals throughout
this era regardless of career. Much of that time is spent eating to stay
healthy and energized. However, COVID-19 triggered a trend in North
America wherein employees are walking out of public-facing jobs such as
restaurant table service and retail[^1]. In-house, fast-food, and
cafeteria-style food services are feeling the pressure. The slower
line-ups at the register and the rising price of food affect customer
experience. The team has found a 20% increase in customer preference for
contactless operations post-pandemic[^2]. Should they not react to the
labor shortages and customer preferences, food services will have a more
challenging time competing against the convenience of home delivery and
the lower prices of home-prepared meals.

Team Watts has decided to build an AI image classification system that
could be deployed in cafeterias in various domains such as workplaces,
malls, hospitals, schools, and entertainment facilities. This image
classification system would change consumers’ lives by making grab-and-
go meals more straightforward and more convenient. It proposes a
tangible product, “Watts’ Food Detector,” that permits cafeteria
customers to bypass checkout lineups. The concept is an amalgamation of,
and an improvement on, the self-checkout scanners now used in grocery
stores and pharmacies, the Sobey’s Smart Cart device, the MyFitnessPal
app, and the customer stamp- card concept used by the Marché-Mövenpick
and Vapiano chains in Germany. The goal is to increase traffic volume
during peak hours and influence repeat sales through a positive customer
experience.
